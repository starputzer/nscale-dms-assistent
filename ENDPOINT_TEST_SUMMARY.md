## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Database Tables
- `users` table is missing (affects Admin Users endpoints)
- `feedback` table is missing (affects Admin Feedback endpoints)

### 2. Missing Route Registrations (404 errors)
Many endpoints return 404, indicating they are not properly registered:
- `/api/auth/user`
- `/api/auth/logout`
- `/api/system/*` endpoints
- `/api/admin/dashboard/*` endpoints
- `/api/admin/statistics/*` endpoints
- `/api/rag/*` endpoints
- Some `/api/knowledge/*` endpoints

### 3. Authentication Issues
- Auth endpoints exist but some are not implemented
- Admin endpoints require proper authentication but fail with database errors

### 4. Working Endpoints
The following endpoint categories are fully functional:
- Sessions management
- Background processing (with auth)
- Advanced documents (OCR status, processing stats)
- Test endpoints

## Recommendations

1. **Database Migration**: Run database migrations to create missing tables
2. **Route Registration**: Check server.py to ensure all routers are properly included
3. **Authentication**: Implement missing auth endpoints (/api/auth/user, /api/auth/logout)
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages for missing routes vs server errors
