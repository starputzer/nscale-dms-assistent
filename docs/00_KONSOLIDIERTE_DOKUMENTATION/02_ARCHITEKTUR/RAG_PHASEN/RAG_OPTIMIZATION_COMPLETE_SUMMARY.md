```

### Key Metrics Tracked:
- Query latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Memory usage trends
- GPU utilization
- Error rates by type
- Intent detection accuracy

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### For Developers:
1. **Always use semantic chunking** for new documents
2. **Monitor cache hit rates** - below 50% indicates tuning needed
3. **Watch memory usage** - trigger optimization at 80%+
4. **Test intent detection** for domain-specific queries
5. **Use batch processing** for bulk operations

### For Operations:
1. **Enable Redis** for production deployments
2. **Set memory limits** appropriately (2-4GB recommended)
3. **Monitor GPU memory** if using CUDA
4. **Configure cache TTLs** based on content update frequency
5. **Review performance reports** weekly

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Fine-tune cross-encoder** on German legal/administrative texts
2. **Implement query result caching** at the API level
3. **Add distributed processing** for multi-node deployments
4. **Integrate with APM tools** (Prometheus, Grafana)
5. **Implement A/B testing** for retrieval strategies
