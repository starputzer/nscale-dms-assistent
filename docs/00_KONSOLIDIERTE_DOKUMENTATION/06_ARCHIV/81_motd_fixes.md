# MOTD Component Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
1. The enhanced MOTD component (`AdminMotd.enhanced.vue`) was missing required properties and methods from the store
2. The store (`motd.ts`) was missing several computed properties and methods expected by the enhanced component
3. UI component imports were incorrect/missing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated MOTD Store (`src/stores/admin/motd.ts`)
- Added missing state properties:
  - `loading` - for tracking API call status
  - `error` - for error messages
  - `previewMode` - for toggling preview mode
  - `savedConfigJSON` - for tracking unsaved changes

- Added computed properties:
  - `hasUnsavedChanges` - to check if there are unsaved changes
  - `previewHtml` - to render content as HTML based on format

- Added missing methods:
  - `updateConfig()` - to update configuration without saving
  - `resetConfig()` - to reset to saved configuration
  - `togglePreviewMode()` - to toggle preview mode

- Enhanced existing methods:
  - `saveConfig()` now updates `savedConfigJSON`
  - `fetchConfig()` now manages loading/error states

### 2. Fixed UI Component Imports
- Updated `src/components/ui/base/index.ts` to export `Select` component
- Added workaround for missing `RadioGroup` component (using Input as fallback)
- Fixed imports in both `AdminMotd.vue` and `AdminMotd.enhanced.vue`

## Current Status
- The MOTD store now has all required properties and methods
- Import issues have been resolved
- The enhanced component should now work with the updated store

## Known Limitations
1. `RadioGroup` component is using a workaround (Input component) - a proper RadioGroup component should be created
2. The enhanced component expects many UI components that aren't actually implemented (ColorPicker, IconPicker, DateTimePicker, etc.)
3. The store uses mock data - proper API integration is needed

## Next Steps
1. Create proper UI components (RadioGroup, ColorPicker, IconPicker, etc.)
2. Implement actual API endpoints for MOTD configuration
3. Test the enhanced MOTD editor with real data
4. Consider simplifying the enhanced component to use only available UI components
