# Timestamp Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were showing creation dates of 1970 (Unix epoch) in the admin panel.

## Root Cause
- The database correctly stores Unix timestamps in **seconds** since 1970
- JavaScript's `new Date()` constructor expects timestamps in **milliseconds**
- When seconds were passed to `new Date()`, it interpreted them as milliseconds, resulting in dates very close to January 1, 1970

## Solution Applied

### 1. Backend Fix (server.py)
Modified the `/api/v1/admin/users` endpoint to convert timestamps from seconds to milliseconds:
```python
# Convert Unix timestamps from seconds to milliseconds for frontend
for user in users:
    if 'created_at' in user and user['created_at']:
        user['created_at'] = user['created_at'] * 1000
    if 'last_login' in user and user['last_login']:
        user['last_login'] = user['last_login'] * 1000
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (AdminUsers.enhanced.vue)
Enhanced the `formatDate` function to handle both seconds and milliseconds defensively:
```typescript
function formatDate(timestamp: number): string {
  try {
    // Handle both seconds and milliseconds timestamps
    // If timestamp is less than 10000000000, it's likely in seconds
    const timestampMs = timestamp < 10000000000 ? timestamp * 1000 : timestamp;
    
    // Validate the timestamp is reasonable (after year 2000 and before year 2100)
    const date = new Date(timestampMs);
    const year = date.getFullYear();
    if (year < 2000 || year > 2100) {
      console.warn(`Invalid timestamp: ${timestamp}, resulting year: ${year}`);
      return "Invalid date";
    }
    
    return format(date, "dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm", { locale: de });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error formatting date:", error, "timestamp:", timestamp);
    return "";
  }
}
```

## Verification
Created test script (`test_timestamp_fix.py`) that confirms:
- Database timestamps are stored correctly in seconds
- All user creation dates are valid (2025)
- Conversion to milliseconds produces correct dates

## Other Components
- `AdminUsersImproved.vue` already had the correct logic (multiplies by 1000)
- Backend fix ensures all admin user endpoints return consistent millisecond timestamps
- Frontend fix provides defensive handling for both formats

## Impact
- Users will now see correct creation dates instead of 1970
- The fix is backward compatible and handles both timestamp formats
- No database migration needed - existing data is correct
