# Streaming Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enabled Streaming in Frontend
**File:** `/opt/nscale-assist/app/src/stores/sessions.ts`
- Changed `streamingEnabled = false` to `streamingEnabled = true` on line 900
- This re-enables the SSE streaming functionality

### 2. Fixed UUID Support in Streaming Endpoint
**File:** `/opt/nscale-assist/app/api/server.py`
- Updated `/api/question/stream` endpoint to handle UUID-based session IDs
- Added logic to convert UUID to numeric ID for database operations
- Preserves UUID for new session creation if needed

## How Streaming Works

1. Frontend sends request to `/api/question/stream` with:
   - `question`: The user's question
   - `session_id`: UUID-based session ID
   - Authorization header with JWT token

2. Backend:
   - Converts UUID to numeric ID for database operations
   - Creates session if it doesn't exist
   - Streams response using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Each chunk sent as: `data: {"content": "text", "type": "content"}\n\n`
   - End signal: `event: done\ndata: \n\n`

3. Frontend:
   - Uses fetch API with streaming support
   - Processes chunks as they arrive
   - Updates UI in real-time

## Testing
After restarting the server, streaming should work properly. The response will be streamed character by character instead of appearing all at once.

## Potential Issues
If streaming still doesn't work:
1. Check if reverse proxy (nginx) has buffering disabled
2. Ensure no middleware is buffering responses
3. Verify CORS headers allow streaming
