# Admin Authentication Fix

## Problem

There were issues with the authentication for the admin user with the email `martin@danglefeet.com`. The user existed but had either incorrect permissions or an incorrect password.

## Solution

The following steps were taken to fix the authentication:

1. Updated the user `martin@danglefeet.com` to have admin role
2. Set the password for `martin@danglefeet.com` to `123`
3. Added `martin@danglefeet.com` to the `ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable
4. Updated the server's login fallback to use `martin@danglefeet.com` as the test account

## Implementation Details

### Scripts Created

1. `update_martin_password.py` - Updates the password for `martin@danglefeet.com` to `123`
2. `update_admin_env.py` - Updates the `.env` file to include `martin@danglefeet.com` in `ADMIN_EMAILS`
3. `update_login_fallback.py` - Updates the server's login fallback mechanism to use `martin@danglefeet.com`

### Testing

The solution was tested with:

1. Direct login using curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"martin@danglefeet.com","password":"123"}'
   ```

2. Access to admin endpoints:
   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"martin@danglefeet.com","password":"123"}' | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/admin/users
   ```

Both tests confirmed that the user can successfully authenticate and access admin resources.

## Future Improvements

For future improvements, consider:

1. Implementing a more secure password policy
2. Adding proper account management UI in the admin panel
3. Implementing a proper environment variable management system
4. Using a more robust password hashing algorithm than SHA-256
