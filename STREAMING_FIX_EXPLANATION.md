# Chat Streaming Fix Implementation

## Problem Summary

The streaming functionality for chat messages was experiencing multiple issues:

1. Backend Error 422: The authentication token was being sent in the URL instead of the header, causing validation issues.
2. Frontend Streaming Issues: The `EventSource` API couldn't handle Authorization headers properly.
3. UI Reactivity Problems: The streamed content wasn't updating properly in the UI.
4. Bridge Synchronization Errors: The bridge system had problems with undefined values.

## Solution Implementation

### Backend Fixes

1. Query parameter handling was improved in `api/server.py`:
   - Explicit declaration of query parameters with `Query()`
   - URL decoding with `urllib.parse.unquote_plus()`
   - Enhanced parameter validation

2. A new streaming endpoint was created in `api/fixed_stream_endpoint.py`:
   - Properly handles authentication tokens from headers
   - Better error handling and reporting
   - Improved SSE formatting

### Frontend Fixes (in `src/stores/sessions.ts`)

1. Authentication Token Handling:
   - Removed token from URL parameters
   - Added token to proper Authorization header

2. Streaming Implementation:
   - Replaced `EventSource` with `fetch` and `ReadableStream`
   - Better error recovery mechanism
   - Implemented a dual approach with fallback to non-streaming API

3. Message Reactivity Fix:
   - Created dedicated `updateMessageContent` function for proper Vue 3 reactivity
   - Used reference replacement (creating new array/object references) instead of direct mutation
   - Added `nextTick` calls to ensure UI updates

4. Added Debug Visibility:
   - Created `StreamingDebugPanel.vue` component for real-time debugging
   - Added visual indicators for streaming status

### UI Component Updates

1. `MessageItem.vue`:
   - Special handling for streaming messages (avoiding heavy Markdown processing)
   - Added visual indicator for streaming status
   - Improved error handling and fallbacks

2. `MessageList.vue`:
   - Disabled virtualization for more stable rendering during streaming
   - Added debug elements to show message state
   - Enhanced scroll management during streaming

3. `ChatView.vue`:
   - Added cancel streaming functionality
   - Improved error handling
   - Better UI feedback during streaming

## Technical Implementation Details

### Non-streaming vs. Streaming Message Handling

The system now differentiates between streaming and non-streaming messages:

1. For non-streaming:
   - Standard POST request to `/api/question`
   - Single response with complete message content

2. For streaming:
   - Creates initial empty message with `isStreaming: true`
   - Establishes fetch connection with `ReadableStream`
   - Processes SSE data incrementally
   - Updates message content with each token/chunk
   - Marks message as complete when stream ends

### Reactivity Pattern

The key reactivity pattern implemented to fix UI updates:

```typescript
// Create a NEW array reference with a NEW object at the updated index
const newMessages = [...messages.value[sessionId]];
newMessages[messageIndex] = {
  ...newMessages[messageIndex],
  content: newContent,
  isStreaming: isStreaming,
  status: isStreaming ? "pending" : "sent",
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};

// Replace the entire messages object to ensure Vue detects the change
const newMessagesObj = { ...messages.value };
newMessagesObj[sessionId] = newMessages;
messages.value = newMessagesObj;
```

### Error Handling Strategy

The system now implements a multi-layered error recovery approach:

1. Primary streaming method via `fetch` and `ReadableStream`
2. Fallback to `EventSource` with token in URL (legacy support)
3. Final fallback to non-streaming API if both streaming methods fail
4. User-friendly error messages and recovery options

## Testing & Verification

The fix has been verified with:

- Direct testing of streaming functionality
- Event handling testing for proper token processing
- UI responsiveness during streaming
- Error recovery in various network conditions

## Status

✅ Token handling corrected  
✅ Streaming implementation replaced with more robust version  
✅ UI reactivity issues fixed  
✅ Bridge system errors addressed
