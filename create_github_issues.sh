## Objectives:
- Remove mock files from production code
- Eliminate experimental/simple versions
- Consolidate fix implementations
- Review and integrate optimized versions
- Clean up unused type definitions
- Remove legacy archived code

- [ ] #3 Review and consolidate temporary fix files
- [ ] #4 Evaluate optimized implementations for integration or removal
- [ ] #5 Remove unused TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] #6 Remove legacy-archive directory after migration verification
- [ ] #7 Verify and clean up legacy frontend type definitions
- [ ] #8 Develop test suite to verify system integrity post-cleanup
- [ ] #9 Create documentation for cleanup process and decisions

- [ ] Verify batch API operations

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All fixes either integrated or documented
- [ ] No functionality regression
- [ ] Authentication still works correctly
